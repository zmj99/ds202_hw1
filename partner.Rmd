I was not able to knit my partner's file. This is because RStudio is looking for the image in my partner's assignment using absolute path. Since I am working on a different computer with different folder structure and folder naming the specified image path does not exist.  
Error for reference:  
File /Users/zackjohnson/ds202/ds202_hw1/fivethirtyeight_logo.png not found in resource path  
Error: pandoc document conversion failed with error 99  
Execution halted

I had difficulty in reproducing my partner's code since an absolute path was used to incorporate the image.
